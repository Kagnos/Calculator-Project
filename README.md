# Calculator-Project
I'm really proud of this calculator project. This is my most advanced JavaScript project to date and I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it. I think my biggest problem is not writing concise code. When I compare my projects or solutions to others', I see my code is a lot simpler and less efficient. I believe this will get better with more practice though. Working through this project, I've learned and gotten better at:

* How to listen for and grab keyboard inputs
* How to problem solve and work through logic in my head
* Creating simple, yet intuitive and responsive visual layouts
* Implementing basic screen size media queries
* Creating custom style declarations
* Organizing code to be legible and intuitive when looked at by others
* Committing gits more frequently
* Writing git messages and reflections
* How to work around bugs and unexpected behaviors
* How to work with and implement feedback from others
* So much JavaScript: functions, event listeners, nodelists, methods, arrays, if else statement checks, switch statements, global and local variables, and saving variable references for data.

I achieved everything I set out to do with this project, which is why I'm so proud of it. It works just as I imagined in my head and the logic makes sense. The only part that feels a bit clunky is the way I decided to deal with a character limit. There's probably a better way to code it, but I don't think my 15 character hard limit is a bad solution.

In conclusion, I believe this project is a great stepping stone and I have learned a lot through it. I am excited to continue my coding journey and to look back at this project one day. I have started to have a grasp on JavaScript and I feel more and more excited each day as my skills grow.
